In the framework of bosonic Open String Field Theory (OSFT) we consider the
solutions at different radii of several observables and at different mass level
truncations.
We then use machine learning (ML) techniques to extract the value of the
observable at infinite mass level truncation.
More details can be found looking at the analysis at
\href{https://thesfinox.github.io/ml-sft-trunc/}{this URL} (only the analysis
is accessible, while the original database is not public).
