The 1/N expansion is shown not to be in contradiction with instanton physics at finite (spacetime) volume V. The interplay of large volume V and large N parameter gives rise to two regimes with different theta dependence, one behaving as a dilute instanton gas and the other dominated by the traditional large N picture, where instantons reappear as resonances of the one-loop effective action, even in the absence of regular instantonic solutions. The realms of the two regimes are given in terms of the mass gap m by m\^2 V {$<<$} N and m\^2 V {$>>$} N, respectively. The small volume regime m\^2 V {$<<$} N is relevant for physical effects associated to the physics of the boundary, like the leading role of edge states in the quantum Hall effect, which, however, do not play any role in the thermodynamic limit at large N. Depending on the order in which the limits N -{$>$} \textbackslash infty and V -{$>$} \textbackslash infty are taken, two different theories are obtained; this is the hallmark of a phase transition at 1/N = 0.},

  abstract = {A classical particle in a constant magnetic field undergoes cyclotron motion on a circular orbit. At the quantum level, the fact that all classical orbits are closed gives rise to degeneracies in the spectrum. It is well-known that the spectrum of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field consists of infinitely degenerate Landau levels. Just as for the \$1/r\$ and \$r\^2\$ potentials, one thus expects some hidden accidental symmetry, in this case with infinite-dimensional representations. Indeed, the position of the center of the cyclotron circle plays the role of a Runge-Lenz vector. After identifying the corresponding accidental symmetry algebra, we re-analyze the system in a finite periodic volume. Interestingly, similar to the quantum mechanical breaking of CP invariance due to the \$\textbackslash theta\$-vacuum angle in non-Abelian gauge theories, quantum effects due to two self-adjoint extension parameters \$\textbackslash theta\_x\$ and \$\textbackslash theta\_y\$ explicitly break the continuous translation invariance of the classical theory. This reduces the symmetry to a discrete magnetic translation group and leads to finite degeneracy. Similar to a particle moving on a cone, a particle in a constant magnetic field shows a very peculiar realization of accidental symmetry in quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Calculational tools are provided allowing the determination of tree-level amplitudes for processes involving fermions and bosons in heterotic and superstring theories. A simple representation is given of the cocycle operators that are needed for bosonization of conformal operators, including spin fields and ghosts. This permits explicit computation of all correlation functions. The general m-boson, 2n-fermion tree-level scattering amplitude in the open superstring is derived and a typical calculation of a four-point amplitude in the o(16) × o(16) heterotic string is presented in manifestly Lorentz-covariant form. An analysis of the branch-cut singularities in the o(16) × o(16) model is performed. In addition, the covariant form of the “new formalism” is developed. Particular attention is given to a lattice viewpoint of these results.},

  abstract = {Intersecting Dp-branes often give rise to chiral fermions living on their intersections. We study the construction of four-dimensional chiral gauge theories by considering configurations of type II D(3+n)-branes wrapped on non-trivial n-cycles on T\^\{2n\} x(R\^\{2(3-n)\}/Z\_N), for n=1,2,3. The gauge theories on the four non-compact dimensions of the brane world-volume are generically chiral and non-supersymmetric. We analyze consistency conditions (RR tadpole cancellation) for these models, and their relation to four-dimensional anomaly cancellation. Cancellation of U(1) gauge anomalies involves a Green-Schwarz mechanism mediated by RR partners of untwisted and/or twisted moduli. This class of models is of potential phenomenological interest, and we construct explicit examples of SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) three-generation models. The models are non-supersymmetric, but the string scale may be lowered close to the weak scale so that the standard hierarchy problem is avoided. We also comment on the presence of scalar tachyons and possible ways to avoid the associated instabilities. We discuss the existence of (meta)stable configurations of D-branes on 3-cycles in (T\^2)\^3, free of tachyons for certain ranges of the six-torus moduli.},

  abstract = {Double Field Theory (DFT) is a proposal to incorporate T-duality, a distinctive symmetry of string theory, as a symmetry of a field theory defined on a double configuration space. The aim of this review is to provide a pedagogical presentation of DFT and its applications. We first introduce some basic ideas on T-duality and supergravity in order to proceed to the construction of generalized diffeomorphisms and an invariant action on the double space. Steps towards the construction of a geometry on the double space are discussed. We then address generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications of DFT and their connection to gauged supergravity and flux compactifications. We also discuss U-duality extensions, and present a brief parcours on world-sheet approaches to DFT. Finally, we provide a summary of other developments and applications that are not discussed in detail in the review.},

It follows and summarizes developments that took place mainly at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata” over the last decade, and centred on world-sheet aspects of the constructions now commonly referred to as “orientifolds”. Our presentation aims to bridge the gap between the world-sheet analysis, that first exhibited many of the novel features of these systems, and their geometric description in terms of extended objects, D-branes and O-planes, contributed by many other colleagues, and most notably by J. Polchinski. We therefore proceed through a number of prototype examples, starting from the bosonic string and moving on to ten-dimensional fermionic strings and their toroidal and orbifold compactifications, in an attempt to guide the reader in a self-contained journey to the more recent developments related to the breaking of supersymmetry.},

The coefficients determine couplings of higher-dimensional operators in the effective supergravity action that involve powers of the anti-self-dual N = 2 chiral Weyl superfield and of self-dual gauge field strengths superpartners of the D5-brane coupling modulus. In the field theory limit, the result reproduces the Nekrasov partition function in the two-parameter Ω-background, in agreement with a recent proposal.},

Since contact terms may arise from the exchange of string massive states, we investigate and show that some three points amplitudes with one massive state in the open string sector are divergent on the time-dependent orbifolds. To check that divergences are associated with the existence of a discrete zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the subspace with vanishing volume, we construct the Generalized Null Boost Orbifold where this phenomenon can be turned on and off.},

The stable configuration for two similar branes occurs when they are anti-parallel. For branes of different dimensions stability is attained for either parallel or anti-parallel configurations and when dimensions differ by four the amplitude vanishes at the stable point. The results serve as more evidence that D-branes are stringy descriptions of non-perturbative extended solutions of SUGRA theories, as low energy approximation of superstrings.},

  abstract = {It has long been clear that the conformal bootstrap is associated with a rich geometry. In this paper we undertake a systematic exploration of this geometric structure as an object of study in its own right. We study conformal blocks for the minimal SL(2,R) symmetry present in conformal field theories in all dimensions. Unitarity demands that the Taylor coefficients of the four-point function lie inside a polytope U determined by the operator spectrum, while crossing demands they lie on a plane X. The conformal bootstrap is then geometrically interpreted as demanding a non-empty intersection of U and X. We find that the conformal blocks enjoy a surprising positive determinant property. This implies that U is an example of a famous polytope – the cyclic polytope. The face structure of cyclic polytopes is completely understood. This lets us fully characterize the intersection U and X by a simple combinatorial rule, leading to a number of new exact statements about the spectrum and four-point function in any conformal field theory.},

  abstract = {We apply machine learning to the problem of finding numerical Calabi-Yau metrics. Building on Donaldson's algorithm for calculating balanced metrics on K\textbackslash "ahler manifolds, we combine conventional curve fitting and machine-learning techniques to numerically approximate Ricci-flat metrics. We show that machine learning is able to predict the Calabi-Yau metric and quantities associated with it, such as its determinant, having seen only a small sample of training data. Using this in conjunction with a straightforward curve fitting routine, we demonstrate that it is possible to find highly accurate numerical metrics much more quickly than by using Donaldson's algorithm alone, with our new machine-learning algorithm decreasing the time required by between one and two orders of magnitude.},

This involves computing cohomology groups of the differential introduced by Becchi, Rouet, Stora and Tyutin, with the sources of the BRST variations of the fields ("antifields") included in the problem. Applications of this computation to other physical questions (classical deformations of the action, conservation laws) are also considered. The general algebraic techniques developed in the Report can be applied to other gauge theories, for which relevant references are given.},

In turn, the method of induced representations reduces the problem of classifying the representations of the Poincare group ISO(D-1,1) to the classication of the representations of the stability subgroups only. Therefore, an exhaustive treatment of the two most important classes of unitary irreducible representations, corresponding to massive and massless particles (the latter class decomposing in turn into the ``helicity'' and the "infinite-spin" representations) may be performed via the well-known representation theory of the orthogonal groups O(n) (with D-4},

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {We compute string scattering amplitudes in an orbifold of Minkowski space by a boost, and show how certain divergences in the four point function are associated with graviton exchange near the singularity. These divergences reflect large tree-level backreaction of the gravitational field. Near the singularity, all excitations behave like massless fields on a 1+1 dimensional cylinder. For excitations that are chiral near the singularity, we show that divergences are avoided and that the backreaction is milder. We discuss the implications of this for some cosmological spacetimes. Finally, in order to gain some intuition about what happens when backreaction is taken into account, we study an open string rolling tachyon background as a toy model that shares some features with R\^\{1,1\}/Z.},

  abstract = {Arguably the simplest model of a cosmological singularity in string theory, the Lorentzian orbifold \$\textbackslash Real\^\{1,1\}/boost\$ is known to lead to severe divergences in scattering amplitudes of untwisted states, indicating a large backreaction toward the singularity. In this work we take a first step in investigating whether condensation of twisted states may remedy this problem and resolve the spacelike singularity. By using the formal analogy with charged open strings in an electric field, we argue that, contrary to earlier claims, twisted sectors do contain physical scattering states, which can be viewed as charged particles in an electric field. Correlated pairs of twisted states will therefore be produced, by the ordinary Schwinger mechanism. For open strings in an electric field, on-shell wave functions for the zero-modes are determined, and shown to analytically continue to non-normalizable modes of the usual Landau harmonic oscillator in Euclidean space. Closed strings scattering states of the Milne orbifold continue to non-normalizable modes in an unusual Euclidean orbifold of \$\textbackslash Real\^2\$ by a rotation by an irrational angle. Irrespective of the formal analogy with the Milne Universe, open strings in a constant electric field, or colliding D-branes, may also serve as a useful laboratory to study time-dependence in string theory.},

The dilaton potential encodes information about the asymptotic data defining the theories, and encompasses various families such as flat space, \$AdS\$, conformally \$AdS\$ as arising from nonconformal branes, and more general nonrelativistic theories. We find a kind of universal near singularity behaviour independent of the dilaton potential, giving universal interrelations between the exponents defining the time behaviour near the cosmological singularity. More detailed analysis using a scaling ansatz enables finding various classes of cosmological backgrounds, recovering known examples such as the \$AdS\$ Kasner singularity as well finding as new ones. We give some comments on the dual field theory from this point of view.},

  abstract = {These lectures on anomalies are relatively self-contained and intended for graduate students who are familiar with the basics of quantum field theory. We begin with several derivations of the abelian anomaly: anomalous transformation of the measure, explicit computation of the triangle Feynman diagram, relation to the index of the Euclidean Dirac operator. The chiral (non-abelian) gauge anomaly is derived by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram with three non-abelian gauge fields coupled to a chiral fermion. We discuss in detail the relation between anomaly, current non-conservation and non-invariance of the effective action, with special emphasis on the derivation of the anomalous Slavnov-Taylor/Ward identities. We show why anomalies always are finite and local. A general characterization is given of gauge groups and fermion representations which may lead to anomalies in four dimensions, and the issue of anomaly cancellation is discussed, in particular the classical example of the standard model. Then, we move to more formal developments and arbitrary even dimensions. After introducing a few basic notions of differential geometry, in particular characteristic classes, we derive the descent equations. We prove the Wess-Zumino consistency condition and show that relevant anomalies correspond to BRST cohomologies at ghost number one. We discuss why and how anomalies are related to characteristic classes in two more dimensions and outline their computation in terms of the index of an appropriate Dirac operator. Finally we derive the gauge and gravitational anomalies in arbitrary even dimensions from the appropriate index and explain the anomaly cancellations in ten-dimensional IIB supergravity and in type I and heterotic superstrings.},

  abstract = {We consider a \$R\^\{1,d\}/Z\_2\$ orbifold, where \$Z\_2\$ acts by time and space reversal, also known as the embedding space of the elliptic de Sitter space. The background has two potentially dangerous problems: time-nonorientability and the existence of closed time-like curves. We first show that closed causal curves disappear after a proper definition of the time function. We then consider the one-loop vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor. A naive QFT analysis yields a divergent result. We then analyze the stress tensor in bosonic string theory, and find the same result as if the target space would be just the Minkowski space \$R\^\{1,d\}\$, suggesting a zero result for the superstring. This leads us to propose a proper reformulation of QFT, and recalculate the stress tensor. We find almost the same result as in Minkowski space, except for a potential divergence at the initial time slice of the orbifold, analogous to a spacelike Big Bang singularity. Finally, we argue that it is possible to define local S-matrices, even if the spacetime is globally time-nonorientable.},

  abstract = {Using a formulation of quantum electrodynamics in the infinite-momentum frame, we develop a theory to describe the scattering of energetic electrons or photons off an external field. A physical picture emerges which proves to be a realization of Feymnan's "parton" ideas. In this picture the incoming electron is composed of bare constituents (the quanta of the Schrödinger fields) which, at high laboratory energies, interact slowly with one another. Each bare constitutent is scattered from the external field in a simple way and then the constituents again interact among themselves to form the final state. This formalism is applied to elastic electron and photon scattering, bremsstrahlung and pair production, and deep-inelastic electro-production of lepton pairs, and the results of Cheng and Wu and others are recovered in a simple way. In these applications, perturbation theory is used to construct the wave functions of the constituents in the initial and final states.},

  abstract = {Intersecting D-brane models and their T-dual magnetic compactifications yield attractive models of particle physics where magnetic flux plays a twofold role, being the source of fermion chirality as well as supersymmetry breaking. A potential problem of these models is the appearance of tachyons which can only be avoided in certain regions of moduli space and in the presence of Wilson lines. We study the effective four-dimensional field theory for an orientifold compactification of type IIA string theory and the corresponding toroidal compactification of type I string theory. After determining the Kaluza-Klein and Landau-level towers of massive states in different sectors of the model, we evaluate their contributions to the one-loop effective potential, summing over all massive states, and we relate the result to the corresponding string partition functions. We find that the Wilson-line effective potential has only saddle points, and the theory is therefore driven to the tachyonic regime. There tachyon condensation takes place and chiral fermions acquire a mass of the order of the compactification scale. We also find evidence for a tachyonic behaviour of the volume moduli. More work on tachyon condensation is needed to clarify the connection between supersymmetry breaking, a chiral fermion spectrum and vacuum stability.},

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy S\_A=-Tr rho\_A log rho\_A corresponding to the reduced density matrix rho\_A of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result S\_A\textbackslash sim(c/3) log(l) of Holzhey et al. when A is a finite interval of length l in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems,finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length \textbackslash xi is large but finite, we show that S\_A\textbackslash sim\{\textbackslash cal A\}(c/6)\textbackslash log\textbackslash xi, where \textbackslash cal A is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free-field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract = {We report on a systematic approach for the calculation of the negativity in the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum field theory. The partial transpose rho\_A\^\{T\_2\} of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem A=A\_1 U A\_2 is explicitly constructed as an imaginary-time path integral and from this the replicated traces Tr (rho\_A\^\{T\_2\})\^n are obtained. The logarithmic negativity E= log||rho\_A\^\{T\_2\}|| is then the continuation to n-{$>$}1 of the traces of the even powers. For pure states, this procedure reproduces the known results. We then apply this method to conformally invariant field theories in several different physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or with boundaries. In particular, in the case of two adjacent intervals of lengths L1, L2 in an infinite system, we derive the result E\textbackslash sim(c/4) ln(L1 L2/(L1+L2)), where c is the central charge. For the more complicated case of two disjoint intervals, we show that the negativity depends only on the harmonic ratio of the four end-points and so is manifestly scale invariant. We explicitly calculate the scale-invariant functions for the replicated traces in the case of the CFT for the free compactified boson, but we have not so far been able to obtain the n-{$>$}1 continuation for the negativity even in the limit of large compactification radius. We have checked all our findings against exact numerical results for the harmonic chain which is described by a non-compactified free boson.},

  abstract = {We extend to the O(32) superstring our program of renormalizing string theory by cancelling BRST anomalies between different genus worldsheets. We calculate all the anomalies arising to lowest nontrivial loop order and in general background fields. At tree level, string consistency requires the background fields to satisfy equations of motion which ensure the conformal invariance of the underlying sigma model. We implement loop anomaly cancellation by adding to these equations appropriate loop-order source terms which necessarily break conformal invariance. The procedure leads to consistent loop-corrected equations of motion which can be derived from a spacetime effective action. The loop-order terms in this action incorporate a number of crucial aspects of spacetime physics, including the interaction of the photon with the graviton and the interactions of the antisymmetric tensor field with the gauge field which are responsible for spacetime gauge anomaly cancellation. We take these results as compelling evidence that loop-corrected string theory is associated with sigma models which are not conformally invariant in the usual sense. An extended version of conformal invariance, whose deep structure has yet to be uncovered, presumably incorporates string loop physics. © 1988.},

For objects of arbitrary shapes, even made from idealized materials, the calculation of the associated zero-point (Casimir) energy is an analytically intractable challenge. We propose a new numerical approach to this problem based on machine-learning techniques and illustrate the effectiveness of the method in a (2+1) dimensional scalar field theory. The Casimir energy is first calculated numerically using a Monte-Carlo algorithm for a set of the Dirichlet boundaries of various shapes. Then, a neural network is trained to compute this energy given the Dirichlet domain, treating the latter as black-and-white pixelated images. We show that after the learning phase, the neural network is able to quickly predict the Casimir energy for new boundaries of general shapes with reasonable accuracy.},

Pure Yang-Mills theory (without matter) with a simple and simply connected gauge group has a mixed anomaly between its one-form global symmetry (associated with the center) and the periodicity of the \$\textbackslash theta\$-parameter. This anomaly is at the root of many recently discovered properties of these theories, including their phase transitions and interfaces. These new anomalies can be used to extend this understanding to systems without discrete symmetries (such as time-reversal). We also study \$SU(N)\$ and \$Sp(N)\$ gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation. Here we find a mixed anomaly between the flavor symmetry group and the \$\textbackslash theta\$-periodicity. Again, this anomaly unifies distinct recently-discovered phenomena in these theories and controls phase transitions and the dynamics on interfaces.},

  abstract = {We study string propagation in a spacetime with positive cosmological constant, which includes a circle whose radius approaches a finite value as |t|\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty, and goes to zero at t=0. Near this cosmological singularity, the spacetime looks like R\^\{1,1\}/Z. In string theory, this spacetime must be extended by including four additional regions, two of which are compact. The other two introduce new asymptotic regions, corresponding to early and late times, respectively. States of quantum fields in this spacetime are defined in the tensor product of the two Hilbert spaces corresponding to the early time asymptotic regions, and the S-matrix describes the evolution of such states to states in the tensor product of the two late time asymptotic regions. We show that string theory provides a unique continuation of wavefunctions past the cosmological singularities, and allows one to compute the S-matrix. The incoming vacuum evolves into an outgoing state with particles. We also discuss instabilities of asymptotically timelike linear dilaton spacetimes, and the question of holography in such spaces. Finally, we briefly comment on the relation of our results to recent discussions of de Sitter space.},

  abstract = {Attempts to consider evolution across space-time singularities often lead to quantum systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians developing an isolated singularity as a function of time. Examples include matrix theory in certain singular time-dependent backgounds and free quantum fields on the two-dimensional compactified Milne universe. Due to the presence of the singularities in the time dependence, the conventional quantum-mechanical evolution is not well-defined for such systems. We propose a natural way, mathematically analogous to renormalization in conventional quantum field theory, to construct unitary quantum evolution across the singularity. We carry out this procedure explicitly for free fields on the compactified Milne universe and compare our results with the matching conditions considered in earlier work (which were based on the covering Minkowski space).},

  abstract = {The structure of the MSSM is reviewed. We first motivate the particle content of the theory by examining the quantum numbers of the known standard model particles and by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Once the particle content is fixed we can write down the most general renormalizable superpotential. However such a superpotential will contain terms breaking lepton and baryon number which leads us to the concept of R-parity conservation. The question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed next. We list the possible soft breaking terms. However the Lagrangian involving the most general soft breaking terms is phenomenologically intractable because of the appearance of the many new parameters. It also leads to some unacceptable predictions. To reduce the number of parameters we restrict ourself to the case with universal soft breaking terms at the GUT scale. We motivate the need for universal soft breaking terms by the apparent unification of gauge couplings in the MSSM and by the absence of flavor changing neutral currents. Then we discuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Radiative breaking arises because the one loop corrections involving the large top Yukawa coupling change the sign of the soft breaking mass parameter of the up-type Higgs doublet, this way introducing a nontrivial minimum in the Higgs potential. Finally we give an overview of the possible mixings in the MSSM and enumerate the physical (mass eigenstate) fields together with the mass matrices.},

  abstract = {Bros, Epstein and Glaser proved crossing symmetry of the S-matrix of a theory without massless fields by using certain analyticity properties of the off-shell momentum space Green's function in the complex momentum plane. The latter properties follow from representing the momentum space Green's function as Fourier transform of the position space Green's function, satisfying certain properties implied by the underlying local quantum field theory. We prove the same analyticity properties of the momentum space Green's functions in superstring field theory by directly working with the momentum space Feynman rules even though the corresponding properties of the position space Green's function are not known. Our result is valid to all orders in perturbation theory, but requires, as usual, explicitly subtracting / regulating the non-analyticities associated with massless particles. These results can also be used to prove other general analyticity properties of the S-matrix of superstring theory.},

  author = {De Roo, Frederik},
  date = {2010},
  abstract = {General relativity posits that spacetime is not a xed structure but that it is represented by a dynamical metric eld. The gravitational attraction between matter appears as follows: the dynamics of the metric eld is related to the distribution of matter throughout the universe, and the propagation of matter through spacetime is in uenced by the metric eld that represents the universe. After the discovery that matter particles and microscopic forces obey quantum mechanical laws, it has thus become necessary to quantize the metric eld as well. One of the research lines for a consistent theory of quantum gravity has led to string theory. String theory describes the gravitational interaction in terms of gravitons, which are the quanta of the gravitational force. In string theory it is assumed that at the smallest scales elementary particles have a stringlike nature instead of a pointlike nature. But the behaviour of strings on time-dependent backgrounds such as our expanding universe is not well understood yet. General relativity predicts the existence of gravitational singularities at the classical level: our universe started with the big bang, and massive stars can collapse into black holes. A theory that describes quantum gravitational effects should elucidate our understanding of these singularities. The existence of these singularities also raises the question whether propagation of quantum elds through a singularity is possible (and how it should be formulated). String theory can already deal with some timelike singularities but not yet with spacelike singularities like the big bang. Near singularities, strings often interact strongly. A formulation of string theory that allows to take strong interactions between strings into account is given by matrix theory. Matrix theory models that describe singularities often have a dual translation in terms of a quantum eld theory that is dened on a singular background spacetime. In this dissertation we investigate these issues. We use a geometric regularization prescription to dene the evolution of a free scalar eld and of a free string through a singularity in an unambiguous manner. Remarkably, this geometric regularization seems to reveal there is a certain feature of discreteness related to the evolution across the singularity. We also consider an important class of time-dependent backgrounds that can be investigated in string theory. This class is called gravitational plane waves. These plane waves can be used to investigate the strong curvature eects related to a singularity. Our study shows that it is necessary to take into account that the strings can interact strongly near the singularity. In order to obtain a better understanding of matrix theory on a plane wave background we investigate solutions that describes D-branes in plane wave backgrounds. D-branes are objects that appear in string theory besides strings, and that are important for the formulation of matrix theory.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

By projecting the boundary state on the massless states of the closed string we obtain the tension, the R-R charge and the large distance behavior of the classical solution.

We also show that in the R-R sector the boundary state, written in a picture which treats asymmetrically the left and right components, directly yields the R-R gauge potentials.},

Using the fact that gauge symmetry arises from a supersymmetric affine Kac-Moody algebra, and demanding unitarity of the underlying world-sheet field theory, we show that no such vacua can yield the particle spectrum of the standard model. Of the gauge theories which are permitted by unitarity, we find that many can be constructed explicitly as orbifolds which twist the left- and right-moving degrees of freedom of the string asymmetrically; among these are three N = 4 supersymmetric models - which have previously been constructed in a quite different fashion - and two N = 1 supersymmetric models with chiral gauge representations for the massless fermions.},

  abstract = {We revisit the question of predicting both Hodge numbers \$h\^\{1,1\}\$ and \$h\^\{2,1\}\$ of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) 3-folds using machine learning (ML), considering both the old and new datasets built respectively by Candelas-Dale-Lutken-Schimmrigk / Green-H\textbackslash "ubsch-Lutken and by Anderson-Gao-Gray-Lee. In real world applications, implementing a ML system rarely reduces to feed the brute data to the algorithm. Instead, the typical workflow starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) which aims at understanding better the input data and finding an optimal representation. It is followed by the design of a validation procedure and a baseline model. Finally, several ML models are compared and combined, often involving neural networks with a topology more complicated than the sequential models typically used in physics. By following this procedure, we improve the accuracy of ML computations for Hodge numbers with respect to the existing literature. First, we obtain 97\% (resp. 99\%) accuracy for \$h\^\{1,1\}\$ using a neural network inspired by the Inception model for the old dataset, using only 30\% (resp. 70\%) of the data for training. For the new one, a simple linear regression leads to almost 100\% accuracy with 30\% of the data for training. The computation of \$h\^\{2,1\}\$ is less successful as we manage to reach only 50\% accuracy for both datasets, but this is still better than the 16\% obtained with a simple neural network (SVM with Gaussian kernel and feature engineering and sequential convolutional network reach at best 36\%). This serves as a proof of concept that neural networks can be valuable to study the properties of geometries appearing in string theory.},

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large- scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set collection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1\% of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90\% in the 84.3\% of the data sets. However, the difference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3\% of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and 3 members in the top-20, respectively).},

We write the classical solution as a sum of a product of two hypergeometric functions. Differently from all the previous cases with three D-branes, the solution is not holomorphic and suggests that the classical bosonic string knows when the configuration may be supersymmetric. We show how this configuration reduces to the standard Abelian twist field computation. From the phenomenological point of view, the Yukawa couplings between chiral matter at the intersection in this configuration are more suppressed with respect to the factorized case in the literature.},

We further provide arguments in favour of the universality of our construction which covers a wide class of models all of which engineer the same gauge theory. We reproduce the corresponding Nekrasov partition function once the \$\textbackslash backslashOmega\$-deformation is included and the appropriate field theory limit taken. This is achieved by calculating the topological amplitudes \$F\_g\$ in the string models. In addition to heterotic and type II constructions, we also realise the mass deformation in type I theory, thus leading to a natural way of uplifting the result to the instanton sector.},

It starts by reviewing aspects of relativistic field theory in Minkowski spacetime. After introducing the relevant ingredients of differential geometry and gravity, some basic supergravity theories (D=4 and D=11) and the main gauge theory tools are explained. In the second half of the book, complex geometry and N=1 and N=2 supergravity theories are covered. Classical solutions and a chapter on AdS/CFT complete the book. Numerous exercises and examples make it ideal for Ph.D. students and with applications to model building, cosmology and solutions of supergravity theories, it is also invaluable to researchers"--},

  abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

  abstract = {Gradient boosting constructs additive regression models by sequentially fitting a simple parameterized function (base learner) to current “pseudo”-residuals by least squares at each iteration. The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

We find that coset methods faithfully reproduce the description of low energy physics in terms of massive gauge bosons and discover that the St\$\textbackslash backslash\$"uckelberg replacement commonly employed when treating massive gauge theories arises in a natural manner. Uses of the methods are considered in various contexts, including generalizations to \$p\$-form gauge fields.

  abstract = {We present a pedagogical overview of flux compactifications in string theory, from the basic ideas to the most recent developments. We concentrate on closed string fluxes in type II theories. We start by reviewing the supersymmetric flux configurations with maximally symmetric four-dimensional spaces. We then discuss the no-go theorems (and their evasion) for compactifications with fluxes. We analyze the resulting four-dimensional effective theories, as well as some of its perturbative and non-perturbative corrections, focusing on moduli stabilization. Finally, we briefly review statistical studies of flux backgrounds.},

  abstract = {A set of infinitesimal Virasoro L ⊗ Virasoro R diffeomorphisms are presented which act non-trivially on the horizon of a generic Kerr black hole with spin J. The covariant phase space formalism provides a formula for the Virasoro charges as surface integrals on the horizon. Integrability and associativity of the charge algebra are shown to require the inclusion of 'Wald-Zoupas' counterterms. A counterterm satisfying the known consistency requirement is constructed and yields central charges c L = c R = 12J. Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes. We are deeply saddened to lose our much-loved friend and collaborator Stephen Hawking whose contributions to black hole physics remained vitally stimulating to the very end. This paper summarizes the status of our long-term project on large diffeomorphisms, soft hair and the quantum structure of black holes until the end of our time together.},

  abstract = {Gauge symmetry breaking by boundary conditions on a manifold is known to be equivalent to Wilson-line breaking through a background gauge field, and is therefore spontaneous. These equivalent pictures are related by a non-periodic gauge transformation. However, we find that boundary condition gauge symmetry breaking on orbifolds is explicit; there is no gauge where all the breaking can be attributed to a background gauge field. In the case of a five-dimensional SU(5) grand unified theory on S\^1/Z\_2, the vacuum with gauge symmetry broken to SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) and that with SU(5) preserved are completely disconnected: there is no physical process which causes tunneling between the two. This allows a certain localized explicit breaking of SU(5) on one of the orbifold fixed points in the theory with SU(5) breaking. Split multiplets on this fixed point are shown not to induce violations of unitarity in scattering amplitudes.},

This generalizes previous work in D=4 space-time dimensions. The main focus are D=6,8 and D=10 superstring compactifications for which correlation functions with four and more spin fields are computed. More precisely, we present every non-vanishing six-point function. A number of results can even be derived for arbitrary D. A closed formula for the correlators {$<$}psi ... psi SS{$>$} with any number of fermions psi and two spin fields S in D space-time dimensions is given for arbitrary genus. Moreover, in D=6 and for arbitrary genus, we find a general formula for the correlators {$<$}S dot S ... S dot S{$>$}. The latter serve as basic building blocks to construct higher-point fermionic correlation functions. In D=8 we can profit from the SO(8)-triality to derive further tree-level correlators with a large numbers of spin fields.},

This generalized boundary state is BRST invariant and satisfy the non-linear boundary conditions with non-constant gauge field strength. This boundary state contains divergence which is identical with the loop divergence in a superstring sigma model. Hence vanishing of the beta function in the superstring sigma model corresponds to a well-defined boundary state with no divergence. The coupling of a single closed superstring massless mode with multiple open string massless modes is encoded in the boundary state, and we confirm that derivative correction to the D-brane action in this sector vanishes up to the first non-trivial order O(alpha'(derivative)\^2). Combining T-dualities, we incorpolate also general configurations of the scalar fields on the D-brane, and construct boundary states representing branes stuck to another D-brane, with use of BIon configuration.},

  abstract = {We present a deep neural network representation of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and demonstrate the emergence of the bulk metric function via the learning process for given data sets of response in boundary quantum field theories. The emergent radial direction of the bulk is identified with the depth of the layers, and the network itself is interpreted as a bulk geometry. Our network provides a data-driven holographic modeling of strongly coupled systems. With a scalar \$\textbackslash phi\^4\$ theory with unknown mass and coupling, in unknown curved spacetime with a black hole horizon, we demonstrate our deep learning (DL) framework can determine them which fit given response data. First, we show that, from boundary data generated by the AdS Schwarzschild spacetime, our network can reproduce the metric. Second, we demonstrate that our network with experimental data as an input can determine the bulk metric, the mass and the quadratic coupling of the holographic model. As an example we use the experimental data of magnetic response of a strongly correlated material Sm\$\_\{0.6\}\$Sr\$\_\{0.4\}\$MnO\$\_3\$. This AdS/DL correspondence not only enables gravity modeling of strongly correlated systems, but also sheds light on a hidden mechanism of the emerging space in both AdS and DL.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Working in a \$1/J\$ expansion, we find that the large-\$J\$ sector of both examples is controlled by a conformally invariant effective Lagrangian for a Goldstone boson of the global symmetry. For both these theories, we find that the lowest state with charge \$J\$ is always a scalar operator whose dimension \$\textbackslash Delta\_J\$ satisfies the sum rule \$ J\^2 \textbackslash Delta\_J - \textbackslash left( \textbackslash tfrac\{J\^2\}\{2\} + \textbackslash tfrac\{J\}\{4\} + \textbackslash tfrac\{3\}\{16\} \textbackslash right) \textbackslash Delta\_\{J-1\} - \textbackslash left( \textbackslash tfrac\{J\^2\}\{2\} - \textbackslash tfrac\{J\}\{4\} + \textbackslash tfrac\{3\}\{16\} \textbackslash right) \textbackslash Delta\_\{J+1\} = 0.04067 \$ up to corrections that vanish at large \$J\$. The spectrum of low-lying excited states is also calculable explcitly: For example, the second-lowest primary operator has spin two and dimension \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash ll J + \textbackslash sqrt\{3\}\$. In the supersymmetric case, the dimensions of all half-integer-spin operators lie above the dimensions of the integer-spin operators by a gap of order \$J\^\{1/2\}\$. The propagation speeds of the Goldstone waves and heavy fermions are \$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{2\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash pm \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}\$ times the speed of light, respectively. These values, including the negative one, are necessary for the consistent realization of the superconformal symmetry at large \$J\$.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics is among the most important and successful mathematical model for describing our physical reality. The traditional formulation of quantum mechanics is linear and algebraic. In contrast classical mechanics is a geometrical and non-linear theory that is defined on a symplectic manifold. However, after invention of general relativity, we are convinced that geometry is physical and effect us in all scale. Hence the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics sought to give a unified picture of physical systems based on its underling geometrical structures, e.g., now, the states are represented by points of a symplectic manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric, the observables are real-valued functions on the manifold, and the quantum evolution is governed by a symplectic flow that is generated by a Hamiltonian function. In this work we will give a compact introduction to main ideas of geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. We will provide the reader with the details of geometrical structures of both pure and mixed quantum states. We will also discuss and review some important applications of geometric quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

We consider all cases of bulk, fractional and rigid D6-branes on T6/OR and the orbifolds T6/(Z(N)xOR) and T6/(Z(2)xZ(2M)xOR) without and with discrete torsion, which differ in the number of bulk complex structures and in the bulk Kaehler potential. Our analysis includes all supersymmetric configurations of vanishing and non-vanishing angles among D6-branes and O6-planes - correcting some results in the literature -, and all possible Wilson line and displacement moduli are taken into account. These results are of essential importance for the construction of the related effective field theory of phenomenologically appealing D-brane models. As first examples, we compute the complete perturbative gauge kinetic functions and Kaehler metrics for some T6/Z(2)xZ(2) models with rigid D-branes of arXiv:0902.1694 [hep-th] by Angelantonj et al., for which we correct the previous misidentifications of some gauge factors and charged matter states. As a second class of examples, the Kaehler metrics and gauge kinetic functions for the fractional QCD and leptonic D6-brane stacks of the Standard Model on T6/Z(6') from arXiv:0806.3039 [hep-th] by Gmeiner and Honecker are given.},

  abstract = {The zero modes of closed strings on a torus –the torus coordinates plus dual coordinates conjugate to winding number– parameterize a doubled torus. In closed string field theory, the string field depends on all zero-modes and so can be expanded to give an infinite set of fields on the doubled torus. We use the string field theory to construct a theory of massless fields on the doubled torus. Key to the consistency is a constraint on fields and gauge parameters that arises from the L\_0 - \$\textbackslash backslash\$bar L\_0=0 condition in closed string theory. The symmetry of this double field theory includes usual and 'dual diffeomorphisms', together with a T-duality acting on fields that have explicit dependence on the torus coordinates and the dual coordinates. We find that, along with gravity, a Kalb-Ramond field and a dilaton must be added to support both usual and dual diffeomorphisms. We construct a fully consistent and gauge invariant action on the doubled torus to cubic order in the fields. We discuss the challenges involved in the construction of the full nonlinear theory. We emphasize that the doubled geometry is physical and the dual dimensions should not be viewed as an auxiliary structure or a gauge artifact.},

It is shown that the two-dimensional Zn-orbifolds (n=2, 3, 4, 6), which are the typical of abelian orbifolds, give the fully modular invariant vacuum amplitudes. On the other hand, the su(3) and o(6) Weyl orbifolds, which are the simplest examples of non-abelian orbifolds, give only partial modular invariance due to the existence of the subspace which escapes from the action of some non-trivial elements of the Weyl group.},

The electromagnetic action in the eikonal limit is localized on a contour in a two-dimensional Minkowski subspace of four-dimensional space-time. The exact S-matrix of this reduced theory reproduces the eikonal approximation. In this way, we apply the recent gravitational consideration of't Hooft as well and Verlinde and Verlinde to electromagnetism.},

Selected focus topics feature D-branes as probes of both spacetime and gauge geometry, highlighting the role of world-volume curvature and gauge couplings, with some non-Abelian cases. Other advanced topics which are discussed are the (presently) novel tools of research such as fractional branes, the enhancon mechanism, D(ielectric)-branes and the emergence of the fuzzy/non-commutative sphere.},

Reliability depends on the spin of the exchanged field. For scalar fields the eikonal fails at eighth order in perturbation theory, when it misses the leading behavior of the exchange-type diagrams. In a vector theory the eikonal gets the exchange diagrams correctly, but fails by ignoring certain non-exchange graphs which dominate the asymptotic behavior of the full amplitude. For spin--2 tensor fields the eikonal captures the leading behavior of each order in perturbation theory, but the sum of eikonal terms is subdominant to graphs neglected by the approximation. We also comment on the eikonal for Yang-Mills vector exchange, where the additional complexities of the non-abelian theory may be absorbed into Regge-type modifications of the gauge boson propagators.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {The first part of these lecture notes is mostly devoted to a comparative discussion of the three basic large \$N\$ limits, which apply to fields which are vectors, matrices, or tensors of rank three and higher. After a brief review of some physical applications of large \$N\$ limits, we present a few solvable examples in zero space-time dimension. Using models with fields in the fundamental representation of \$O(N)\$, \$O(N)\^2\$, or \$O(N)\^3\$ symmetry, we compare their combinatorial properties and highlight a competition between the snail and melon diagrams. We exhibit the different methods used for solving the vector, matrix, and tensor large \$N\$ limits. In the latter example we review how the dominance of melonic diagrams follows when a special "tetrahedral" interaction is introduced. The second part of the lectures is mostly about the fermionic quantum mechanical tensor models, whose large \$N\$ limits are similar to that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. The minimal Majorana model with \$O(N)\^3\$ symmetry and the tetrahedral Hamiltonian is reviewed in some detail; it is the closest tensor counterpart of the SYK model. Also reviewed are generalizations to complex fermionic tensors, including a model with \$SU(N)\^2\textbackslash backslashtimes O(N)\textbackslash backslashtimes U(1)\$ symmetry, which is a tensor counterpart of the complex SYK model. The bosonic large \$N\$ tensor models, which are formally tractable in continuous spacetime dimension, are reviewed briefly at the end.},

Equivalence is demonstrated by constructing and comparing the loop equations for a parent theory and its orbifold projections. Loop equations for both expectation values of single-trace observables, and for connected correlators of such observables, are considered; hence the demonstrated non-perturbative equivalence applies to the large Nc limits of both string tensions and particle spectra.},

We find that the minimum volume can be approximated via a second order multiple linear regression on standard topological quantities obtained from the corresponding toric diagram. The approximation improves further after invoking a convolutional neural network with the full toric diagram of the Calabi-Yau 3-folds as the input. We are thereby able to circumvent any minimization procedure that was previously necessary and find an explicit mapping between the minimum volume and the topological quantities of the toric diagram. Under the AdS/CFT correspondence, the minimum volumes of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds correspond to central charges of a class of 4d N=1 superconformal field theories. We therefore find empirical evidence for a function that gives values of central charges without the usual extremization procedure.},

The first six chapters give an introduction to supersymmetry in four spacetime dimensions, they fill about two thirds of the lecture notes and are in principle self-contained. The remaining two chapters are devoted to extra spacetime dimensions which are in the end combined with the concept of supersymmetry.

  abstract = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of meta-algorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) function. Meta-algorithms build on base algorithms---such as Random Forests (RF), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) or neural networks---to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a new meta-algorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other, and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the meta-learners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our new X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper we discussed, among other things, the effect of duality transformations on the open bosonic string theory. Namely, we conjectured that a macroscopic object, the D-brane, effectively interacts with closed and open string modes in the low energy limit. This conjecture was supported by a string scattering amplitude calculation. In this letter we report on a σ-model calculation in the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann theory. We find an action of the Dirac-Born-Infeld type restricted to (26−k)-dimensions.},

However, the analysis can be made difficult because of multicollinearity among regressors, which produces biased coefficients and negative inputs to multiple determination from presum ably useful regressors. To solve this problem we apply a tool from the co-operative games theory, the Shapley Value imputation. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the Shapley Value and show that it provides consistent results in the presence of multicollinearity.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

  abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees, and gradient boosted trees are the most popular non-linear predictive models used in practice today, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we significantly improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions: 1) The first polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. 2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the general US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

  abstract = {The mass scale of fundamental strings can be as low as few TeV/c\^2 provided that spacetime extends into large extra dimensions. We discuss the phenomenological aspects of weakly coupled low mass string theory related to experimental searches for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider the extensions of the Standard Model based on open strings ending on D-branes, with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of D-branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. We focus on the model-independent, universal features of low mass string theory. We compute, collect and tabulate the full-fledged string amplitudes describing all 2-{$>$}2 parton scattering subprocesses at the leading order of string perturbation theory. We cast our results in a form suitable for the implementation of stringy partonic cross sections in the LHC data analysis. The amplitudes involving four gluons as well as those with two gluons plus two quarks do not depend on the compactification details and are completely model-independent. They exhibit resonant behavior at the parton center of mass energies equal to the masses of Regge resonances. The existence of these resonances is the primary signal of string physics and should be easy to detect. On the other hand, the four-fermion processes like quark-antiquark scattering include also the exchanges of heavy Kaluza-Klein and winding states, whose details depend on the form of internal geometry. They could be used as ``precision tests'' in order to distinguish between various compactification scenarios.},

  abstract = {We show that the large \$N\$ limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\textbackslash backslashcal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

  abstract = {The Feynman rules for the Yang-Mills field, originally derived by Feynman and DeWitt from S-matrix theory and the tree theorem, are here derived as a consequence of field theory. Our starting point is the gauge-independent, path-dependent formalism which we proposed earlier. The path-dependent Green's functions in this theory are expressed in terms of auxiliary, path-independent Green's functions in such a way that the path-dependence equation is automatically satisfied. The formula relating the path-dependent to the auxiliary Green's functions is similar to the classical formula relating the path-dependent field variables to the potentials. By using a notation similar but not identical to Schwinger's functional notation, the infinite set of equations satisfied by the Green's function can be replaced by a single equation. When the equation for the auxiliary Green's functions of electromagnetism is solved in a perturbation series, the usual Feynman rules result. For the Yang-Mills field, however, one obtains extra terms; such terms correspond precisely to the closed loops of fictitious scalar particles introduced by Feynman, DeWitt, and Faddeev and Popov.},

  abstract = {It is known that the behavior of a four-point string amplitude at large center-of-mass energy \&s and fixed momentum transfer q =\&—t is not perturbative. We study this region of phase space by summing multiple Reggeized graviton exchange in the eikonal approximation in D space-time dimensions. It is argued that the eikonal sum is at least representative of the summation of the leading powers of s in a string theory. The masslessness and high spin of the (Reggeized) graviton determine the character of the result. For ∼ sq \& 1 (∼ is the gravitational coupling), the eikonal amplitude is dominated by single Reggeized graviton exchange. The amplitude in the region x sq »1 is quite nonperturbative in character: simple Regge behavior and the Froissart bound are violated, and the amplitude does not satisfy a fixed-momentum-transfer dispersion relation. Although order by order the amplitude exhibits in q the exponential decrease of Regge behavior, the final amplitude has only power-law falloff dependent on the number of space-time dimensions but independent of the Regge slope. The unitarity of the partial-wave projections of the eikonal amplitude is also studied. It is demonstrated that for D \&4 noncompact dimensions, the partial-wave amplitudes are bounded as s∼∼x) only for large values of angular momentum, ! xvvs, where xv is the dominant value of the impact parameter. A heuristic argument is presented that the eikonal approximation is successful in unitarizing Reggeized graviton exchange as t/s ∼0 in four dimensions but not in higher dimensions.},

I will introduce superspace formalisms in their simplest cases, and apply them to N = 1 in 4 dimensions, after which I will show how to couple to matter using superspace. I will introduce the procedure of KK dimensional reduction and describe general supergravity theories, in particular the unique 11 dimensional supergravity. I will then exemplify the issues of KK dimensional reduction on the only complete example of full nonlinear compactification, on the gravitational space AdS7 × S4. Finally, I will show how we can use supergravity compactifications together with some string theory information, for realistic embeddings of the Standard Model, via N = 1 supergravity in 4 dimensions.},

It is written entirely in terms of world sheet superfields and if restricted to its bosonic part it is dual to the OPE of two ordinary bosonic Sciuto-Della Selva-Saito vertices. The formalism based on this new “dual Ramual vertex” is completely general and we demonstrate explicitly how to obtain the known results for Coulomb scattering and for the matter sector of the four-fermion amplitude. Finally, the correlation corresponding to the N-boson 2M-fermion reggeon vertex is given.},

And we describe the attemps to construct a lower dimensional bosonic D-brane as an unstable lump solution of the string field equation. We obtain exact results from another formulation, background independent open string field theory. We also discuss some other topics which are related to tachyon condensation in string theory, such as the construction of a D-brane as a noncommutative soliton and some field theory models.

  abstract = {Random Forest is a computationally efficient technique that can operate quickly over large datasets. It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no significant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is significantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no significant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain. Additionally, datasets’ density-based metrics proposed here probably capture some aspects of the VC dimension on decision trees and low-density datasets may require large capacity machines whilst the opposite also seems to be true.},

  abstract = {One of recent trends [30, 31, 14] in network architec- ture design is stacking small filters (e.g., 1x1 or 3x3) in the entire network because the stacked small filters is more ef- ficient than a large kernel, given the same computational complexity. However, in the field of semantic segmenta- tion, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the clas- sification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the ob- ject boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art perfor- mance on two public benchmarks and significantly outper- forms previous results, 82.2\% (vs 80.2\%) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9\% (vs 71.8\%) on Cityscapes dataset.},

Translation invariance along closed cycles forces surprisingly closed string vertices written in open string formalism to acquire Chan-Paton like matrices. Moreover the one loop amplitudes have a single trace for the part of gauge group with the magnetic flux. These peculiarities are also required by consistency of the action of T-duality in the open string sector. In this way we can show to all orders in perturbation theory the equivalence of the T-dual open string theories, gravitational interactions included. We provide also a new and direct derivation of the bosonic boundary state in presence of constant magnetic and Kalb-Ramond background based on Sciuto-Della Selva-Saito vertex formalism.},

In particular the M=1 or M=N-1 amplitude can be expressed without using transcendental functions.

Both the amplitudes normalization and the OPE of two twist fields are unique (up to one constant) when the \$\textbackslash backslash\$epsilon \textbackslash textless-\textbackslash textgreater 1-\$\textbackslash backslash\$epsilon symmetry is imposed.

  abstract = {We study the canonical quantization of a bosonic string in presence of N twist fields. This generalizes the quantization of the twisted string in two ways: the in and out states are not necessarily twisted and the number of twist fields N can be bigger than 2. In order to quantize the theory we need to find the normal modes. Then we need to define a product between two modes which is conserved. Because of this we need to use the Klein–Gordon product and to separate the string coordinate into the classical and the quantum part. The quantum part has different boundary conditions than the original string coordinates but these boundary conditions are precisely those which make the operator describing the equation of motion self adjoint. The splitting of the string coordinates into a classical and quantum part allows the formulation of an improved overlap principle. Using this approach we then proceed in computing the generating function for the generic correlator with L untwisted operators and N (excited) twist fields for branes at angles. We recover as expected the results previously obtained using the path integral. This construction explains why these correlators are given by a generalization of the Wick theorem.},

  abstract = {We consider the simplest possible setting of non-abelian twist fields which corresponds to SU(2) monodromies. We first review the theory of hypergeometric function and of the solutions of the most general Fuchsian second order equation with three singularities. Then we solve the problem of writing the general solution with prescribed U(2) monodromies. We use this result to compute the classical string solution corresponding to three D2 branes in R4. Despite the fact that the configuration is supersymmetric the classical string solution is not holomorphic. Using the equation of motion and not the KLT approach we give a very simple expression for the classical action of the string. We find that the classical action is not proportional to the area of the triangle determined by the branes intersection points since the solution is not holomorphic. Phenomenologically this means that the Yukawa couplings for these supersymmetric configurations on non-factorized tori are suppressed with respect to the factorized case.},

We also find that the product of the electric and magnetic charges is a single Dirac unit, and that the quantum of charge takes the value required by string duality. This is strong evidence that the Dirchlet-branes are intrinsic to type II string theory and are the Ramond-Ramond sources required by string duality. We also note the existence of a previously overlooked 9-form potential in the IIa string, which gives rise to an effective cosmological constant of undetermined magnitude.},

We finally show how Clifford algebras enable us to construct supersymmetric extensions of the Poincar´e algebra. A special attention to the four, ten and eleven-dimensional space-times is given. We then study the representations of the considered supersymmetric algebras and show that representation spaces contain an equal number of bosons and fermions. Supersymmetry turns out to be a symmetry which mixes nontrivially the bosons and the fermions since one multiplet contains bosons and fermions together. We also show how supersymmetry in four and ten dimensions are related to eleven dimensional supersymmetry by compactification or dimensional reduction.},

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

  abstract = {The Ward identities associated with spontaneously broken symmetries can be saturated by Goldstone bosons. However, when space-time symmetries are broken, the number of Goldstone bosons necessary to non-linearly realize the symmetry can be less than the number of broken generators. The loss of Goldstones may be due to a redundancy or the generation of a gap. This phenomena is called an Inverse Higgs Mechanism (IHM). However, there are cases when a Goldstone boson associated with a broken generator does not appear in the low energy theory despite the lack of the existence of an associated IHM. In this paper we will show that in such cases the relevant broken symmetry can be realized, without the aid of an associated Goldstone, if there exists a proper set of operator constraints, which we call a Dynamical Inverse Higgs Mechanism (DIHM). We consider the spontaneous breaking of boosts, rotations and conformal transformations in the context of Fermi liquids, finding three possible paths to symmetry realization: pure Goldstones, no Goldstones and DIHM, or some mixture thereof. We show that in the two dimensional degenerate electron system the DIHM route is the only consistent way to realize spontaneously broken boosts and dilatations, while in three dimensions these symmetries could just as well be realized via the inclusion of non-derivatively coupled Goldstone bosons. We have present the action, including the leading order non-linearities, for the rotational Goldstone (angulon), and discuss the constraint associated with the possible DIHM that would need to be imposed to remove it from the spectrum. Finally we discuss the conditions under which Goldstone bosons are non-derivatively coupled, a necessary condition for the existence of a Dynamical Inverse Higgs Constraint (DIHC), generalizaing the results for Vishwanath and Wantanabe.},

In this paper we extend the computation of one-loop two-point amplitude to the case of intersecting stacks of D3-branes in flat space. The motivation for this calculation is to study the strong coupling holographic BCS model proposed in [3] at finite temperature. We show that the analytical results of [1] and [2] can be embedded into this more general setup. The main technicality involved here is keeping track of the extra color factors coming from the unbroken gauge groups. We further discuss the issues involved in the computation of two point amplitude for case of multiple intersecting stacks of branes.},

  abstract = {The possibility of describing particles other than hadrons (leptons, photons, gauge bosons, gravitons, etc.) by a dual model is explored. The Virasoro-Shapiro model is studied first, interpreting the massless spin-two state of the model as a graviton. We prove that in the limit of zero slope (with gvs2α′ held fixed) one obtains the Einstein theory of gravitation accompanied by a massless scalar field. Next, the Veneziano model is studied for small slope as an expansion in powers of α′. It is known from previous work that the zeroth order term is precisely the Yang-Mills theory of a multiplet of massless vector bosons. We show that there are order α′ terms arising both from the dual tree and loop graphs. The former constitutes a relatively unimportant modification of the Yang-Mills theory, whereas the latter involves the coupling of the massless scalar and graviton states of the Virasoro-Shapiro model. Thus one may take the point of view that gravity arises as a unitarization effect in a dual unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions. In order to obtain the correct values for the electric charge and Newton's constant it is necessary that α′ − 10−34 GeV−2 The coupling of massless scalar states is also studied.},

We indicate how to substitute the Sudakov parametrization in their work in order to simplify their discussion and to make comparisons with the work of Gunion, Brodsky, and Blankenbecler more convenient.

  abstract = {This paper is based on the elementary remark that the extraction of gauge invariant results from a formally gauge invariant theory is ensured if one employs methods of solution that involve only gauge covariant quantities. We illustrate this statement in connection with the problem of vacuum polarization by a prescribed electromagnetic field. The vacuum current of a charged Dirac field, which can be expressed in terms of the Green's function of that field, implies an addition to the action integral of the electromagnetic field. Now these quantities can be related to the dynamical properties of a "particle" with space-time coordinates that depend upon a proper-time parameter. The proper-time equations of motion involve only electromagnetic field strengths, and provide a suitable gauge invariant basis for treating problems. Rigorous solutions of the equations of motion can be obtained for a constant field, and for a plane wave field. A renormalization of field strength and charge, applied to the modified lagrange function for constant fields, yields a finite, gauge invariant result which implies nonlinear properties for the electromagnetic field in the vacuum. The contribution of a zero spin charged field is also stated. After the same field strength renormalization, the modified physical quantities describing a plane wave in the vacuum reduce to just those of the maxwell field; there are no nonlinear phenomena for a single plane wave, of arbitrary strength and spectral composition. The results obtained for constant (that is, slowly varying fields), are then applied to treat the two-photon disintegration of a spin zero neutral meson arising from the polarization of the proton vacuum. We obtain approximate, gauge invariant expressions for the effective interaction between the meson and the electromagnetic field, in which the nuclear coupling may be scalar, pseudoscalar, or pseudovector in nature. The direct verification of equivalence between the pseudoscalar and pseudovector interactions only requires a proper statement of the limiting processes involved. For arbitrarily varying fields, perturbation methods can be applied to the equations of motion, as discussed in Appendix A, or one can employ an expansion in powers of the potential vector. The latter automatically yields gauge invariant results, provided only that the proper-time integration is reserved to the last. This indicates that the significant aspect of the proper-time method is its isolation of divergences in integrals with respect to the proper-time parameter, which is independent of the coordinate system and of the gauge. The connection between the proper-time method and the technique of "invariant regularization" is discussed. Incidentally, the probability of actual pair creation is obtained from the imaginary part of the electromagnetic field action integral. Finally, as an application of the Green's function for a constant field, we construct the mass operator of an electron in a weak, homogeneous external field, and derive the additional spin magnetic moment of α2π magnetons by means of a perturbation calculation in which proper-mass plays the customary role of energy.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

  abstract = {Quantum groups in general and the quantum Anti-de Sitter group \$U\_q(so(2,3))\$ in particular are studied from the point of view of quantum field theory. We show that if \$q\$ is a suitable root of unity, there exist finite-dimensional, unitary representations corresponding to essentially all the classical one-particle representations with (half)integer spin, with the same structure at low energies as in the classical case. In the massless case for spin \$\textbackslash backslashgeq 1\$, the "naive" representations are unitarizable only after factoring out a subspace of "pure gauges", as classically. Unitary many-particle representations are defined, with the correct classical limit. Furthermore, we identify a remarkable element \$Q\$ in the center of \$U\_q(g)\$, which plays the role of a BRST operator in the case of \$U\_q(so(2,3))\$ at roots of unity, for any spin \$\textbackslash backslashgeq 1\$. The associated ghosts are an intrinsic part of the indecomposable representations. We show how to define an involution on algebras of creation and anihilation operators at roots of unity, in an example corresponding to non-identical particles. It is shown how nonabelian gauge fields appear naturally in this framework, without having to define connections on fiber bundles. Integration on Quantum Euclidean space and sphere and on Anti-de Sitter space is studied as well. We give a conjecture how \$Q\$ can be used in general to analyze the structure of indecomposable representations, and to define a new, completely reducible associative (tensor) product of representations at roots of unity, which generalizes the standard "truncated" tensor product as well as our many-particle representations.},

We use both the low-energy Yang-Mills description and the language of string field theory to explain the problem of tachyon condensation on unstable D-branes. We give a self-contained introduction to open string field theory using both conformal field theory and overlap integrals. Our main subjects are the Sen conjectures on tachyon condensation in open string field theory and the evidence that supports these conjectures. We conclude with a discussion of vacuum string field theory and projectors of the star-algebra of open string fields. We comment on the possible role of string field theory in the construction of a nonperturbative formulation of string theory that captures all possible string backgrounds.},

  abstract = {This article develops new techniques for understanding the relationship between the three different mathematical formulations of two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory: conformal nets (axiomatizing observables), vertex operator algebras (axiomatizing fields), and Segal CFTs. It builds upon previous work, which introduced a geometric interpolation procedure for constructing conformal nets from VOAs via Segal CFT, simultaneously relating all three frameworks. This article extends our construction to study the relationship between the representation theory of conformal nets and the representation theory of vertex operator algebras. We define a correspondence between representations in the two contexts, and show how to construct representations of conformal nets from VOAs. We also show that this correspondence is rich enough to relate the respective `fusion product' theories for conformal nets and VOAs, by constructing local intertwiners (in the sense of conformal nets) from intertwining operators (in the sense of VOAs). We use these techniques to show that all WZW conformal nets can be constructed using our geometric interpolation procedure, and apply this to the local equivalence problem for representations of loop groups at positive integral level.},

  abstract = {MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library. It aims to provide a class of floating-point numbers with precise semantics. The main characteristics of MPFR, which make it differ from most arbitrary precision floating-point software tools, are:

    the MPFR code is portable, i.e., the result of any operation does not depend on the machine word size mp\_bits\_per\_limb (64 on most current processors), possibly except in faithful rounding. It does not depend either on the machine rounding mode or rounding precision;
    the precision in bits can be set exactly to any valid value for each variable (including very small precision);
    MPFR provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985 standard, plus away-from-zero, as well as for basic operations as for other mathematical functions. Faithful rounding (partially supported) is provided too, but the results may no longer be reproducible. 

In particular, with a precision of 53 bits and in any of the four standard rounding modes, MPFR is able to exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine floating-point numbers (e.g., double type in C, with a C implementation that rigorously follows Annex F of the ISO C99 standard and FP\_CONTRACT pragma set to OFF) on the four arithmetic operations and the square root, except the default exponent range is much wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented (but can be emulated).

This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or any later version. It is permitted to link MPFR to most non-free programs, as long as when distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a modified MPFR library is provided.},

Light cone string theory is briefly reviewed, but the emphasis is on the covariant approach exploiting world sheet BRST invariance to define string field derivations, integration, and products. Although we try to present the ideas in a general way, we draw on Witten's formulation of open string field theory for most of our examples. We include brief self-contained reviews of both the operator and Lagrangian versions of the BRST formalism employed in this article. There is a detailed account of perturbation theory for Witten's theory, including a few explicit sample calculations. Open problems faced by open superstring field theory and by closed string field theory are discussed. We sketch some of the ideas for attacking them but do not give a definitive resolution. Finally, some formulae relevant to the “bosonization of superghosts” are derived in a self-contained appendix.},

For free fields in our construction there is no particle production from the incoming adiabatic vacuum. When interactions are included the total particle production for fixed external momentum is finite at tree level.

We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient `position refinement' model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation.

Each lecture ends with a series of vignettes detailing the roles solitons play in the quantum dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories in various dimensions.

  abstract = {It has been argued that the bosonic sectors of supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, and of QCD with a single fermion in the antisymmetric (or symmetric) tensor representation, are equivalent in the N→∞ limit. If true, this correspondence can provide useful insight into properties of real QCD (with fundamental representation fermions), such as predictions [with O(1/N) corrections] for the nonperturbative vacuum energy, the chiral condensate, and a variety of other observables. Several papers asserting to have proven this large N “orientifold equivalence” have appeared. By considering theories compactified on R3×S1, we show explicitly that this large N equivalence fails for sufficiently small radius, where our analysis is reliable, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge-conjugation symmetry in QCD with an antisymmetric (or symmetric) tensor representation fermion. This theory is also chirally symmetric for small radius, unlike super-Yang-Mills theory. The situation is completely analogous to large-N equivalences based on orbifold projections: simple symmetry realization conditions are both necessary and sufficient for the validity of the large N equivalence. Whether these symmetry realization conditions are satisfied depends on the specific nonperturbative dynamics of the theory under consideration. Unbroken charge-conjugation symmetry is necessary for validity of the large N orientifold equivalence. Whether or not this condition is satisfied on R4 (or R3×S1 for sufficiently large radius) is not currently known.},

However, the rapid development of the field and various technical barriers (such as properties of Majorana spinors) have prevented many interested physicists from starting active research. This report hopes to provide an introduction which will allow the reader to go from no knowledge at all about supergravity up to the point where present research begins. It is written as a course for graduate students and thus the focus is more on explaining than on reviewing. Most importantly: it is self-contained. We have tried to discuss all major areas of supergravity, including the advanced aspects, but we have placed the emphasis on supergravity as a gauge theory. In this way, this report might be useful as the basis for a graduate course in gauge fields and quantum field theory. Rather than giving some general discussions or refer to the literature for details, we have tried to be explicit. Thus we have not shied away from working out details, and this should be helpful to the reader. Actually, large parts of this report were tried out on students at Stony Brook, and in this way we discovered where more explicit work was required. We must confess that as a result this report is rather long, and we have had nightmares in which the publisher provided it together with a wheelbarrow. In ∼rder to describe the work of our colleagues in detail, we have visited many of them for long discussions. Thus the preparation of this report took more than two years. It is a pleasure to thank them for their cooperation. In addition, we have asked all of our colleagues to send us a list of their publications as a basis for the references in this report.

  abstract = {These are the notes for a Part III course given in the University of Cambridge in autumn 1998. They contain an exposition of the representation theory of the Lie algebras of compact matrix groups, affine Kac-Moody algebras and the Virasoro algebra from a unitary point of view. The treatment uses many of the methods of conformal field theory, in particular the Goddard-Kent-Olive construction and the Kazami-Suzuki supercharge operator, a generalisation of the Dirac operator. The proof of the Weyl character formula is taken from unpublished notes of Peter Goddard. The supersymmetric proof of the Kac character formula for affine Kac-Moody algebras was also found independently at roughly the same time by Greg Landweber in his Harvard Ph.D. dissertation. One of the main novelties of this approach is a very rapid proof of the Feigin-Fuchs character formula for the discrete series representations of the Virasoro algebra. It relies only on the first part of the Friedan-Qiu-Shenker unitarity theorem placing restrictions on the parameter h. Their result, which only uses elementary properties of plane curves, is presented in detail in these notes along with the somewhat harder result for c. A substantially shorter treatment is possible if the final goal is just the Feigin-Fuchs formula, since in that case only the representation theory of affine sl(2) is needed (cf the MSRI summer course given in 2000, http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/opal/wassermann/). The same method has been applied by S. Palcoux to the Neveu-Schwarz algebra and also works for the N=2 superconformal algebra.},

  abstract = {F-theory is perhaps the most general currently available approach to study non-perturbative string compactifications in their geometric, large radius regime. It opens up a wide and ever-growing range of applications and connections to string model building, quantum gravity, (non-perturbative) quantum field theories in various dimensions and mathematics. Its computational power derives from the geometrisation of physical reasoning, establishing a deep correspondence between fundamental concepts in gauge theory and beautiful structures of elliptic fibrations. These lecture notes, which are an extended version of my lectures given at TASI 2017, introduce some of the main concepts underlying the recent technical advances in F-theory compactifications and their various applications. The main focus is put on explaining the F-theory dictionary between the local and global data of an elliptic fibration and the physics of 7-branes in Type IIB compactifications to various dimensions via duality with M-theory. The geometric concepts underlying this dictionary include the behaviour of elliptic fibrations in codimension one, two, three and four, the Mordell-Weil group of rational sections, and the Deligne cohomology group specifying gauge backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Analyzing deep neural networks (DNNs) via information plane (IP) theory has gained tremendous attention recently as a tool to gain insight into, among others, their generalization ability. However, it is by no means obvious how to estimate mutual information (MI) between each hidden layer and the input/desired output, to construct the IP. For instance, hidden layers with many neurons require MI estimators with robustness towards the high dimensionality associated with such layers. MI estimators should also be able to naturally handle convolutional layers, while at the same time being computationally tractable to scale to large networks. None of the existing IP methods to date have been able to study truly deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as the e.g.\textbackslash{} VGG-16. In this paper, we propose an IP analysis using the new matrix--based R\textbackslash 'enyi's entropy coupled with tensor kernels over convolutional layers, leveraging the power of kernel methods to represent properties of the probability distribution independently of the dimensionality of the data. The obtained results shed new light on the previous literature concerning small-scale DNNs, however using a completely new approach. Importantly, the new framework enables us to provide the first comprehensive IP analysis of contemporary large-scale DNNs and CNNs, investigating the different training phases and providing new insights into the training dynamics of large-scale neural networks.},

Sections 1–8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6–8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10–13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11–13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.},

It is argued here that the answer at the quantum level is that an extra \$SU(2)\$ gauge symmetry appears that is supported in the core of the instanton. Thus in particular the quantum heterotic string has vacua with higher rank than is possible in conformal field theory. When \$k\$ instantons collapse at the same point, the enhanced gauge symmetry is \$Sp(k)\$. These results, which can be tested by comparison to Dirichlet five-branes of Type I superstrings and to the ADHM construction of instantons, give the first example for the heterotic string of a non-perturbative phenomenon that cannot be turned off by making the coupling smaller. They have applications to several interesting puzzles about string duality.},

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5\textbackslash backslashtimes \{\textbackslash backslashbf S\}\^5\$ match with the chiral operators of \$\textbackslash backslashN=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \$\textbackslash backslashN=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

This concept, in its global ramifications, is studied through an examination of Dirac's magnetic monopole field. Generalizations to non-Abelian groups are carried out, and result in identification with the mathematical concept of connections on principal fiber bundles.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms have been used widely in various applications and areas. To fit a machine learning model into different problems, its hyper-parameters must be tuned. Selecting the best hyper-parameter configuration for machine learning models has a direct impact on the model's performance. It often requires deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms and appropriate hyper-parameter optimization techniques. Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems. In this paper, optimizing the hyper-parameters of common machine learning models is studied. We introduce several state-of-the-art optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization. This survey paper will help industrial users, data analysts, and researchers to better develop machine learning models by identifying the proper hyper-parameter configurations effectively.},
